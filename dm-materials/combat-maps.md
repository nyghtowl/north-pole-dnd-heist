## 1. GRAND HALL (Hostage Situation)

![Grand Hall](../assets/images/1-la-grand-hall.png)

**Size:** 80×60 ft, 30 ft ceiling  
**Hostages:** Center of room, tables at edges  
**Enemies:** VARIES BY TIME (see below)

### Cover:
- Tables (half, flip for full)
- Stone columns (full)
- Stage (3 ft elevated platform)
- Christmas tree (full, flammable)

### Hazards:
- **HOSTAGES** (NO AOE attacks!)
- Chandeliers (drop for 3d6 damage)
- Fireplace (push enemies in for 2d6 fire)
- Slippery punch spills

### Key Features:
- Secret chimney from Santa's Office or Mrs. Claus's Kitchen (if short on time)
- Coat Check with player gear (guarded by enemies)
- 20-30 hostages clustered center

### Description:
Massive Christmas grand hall with vaulted ceiling, crystal chandeliers, banquet tables covered in festive food. Large Christmas tree in corner. Frightened workshop employees clustered in center. Polar bear in dark armor guards coat check. Gingerbread guards with candy cane crossbows patrol. Stone fireplace crackles. Stage platform at far end.

---

### COMBAT OPTION 1: EARLY ASSAULT (8:00-9:00 PM)
**When Scrooge is Present**

**WARNING:** This is an EXTREMELY DIFFICULT encounter! Not recommended unless players are well-equipped or have a clever plan.

#### Enemy Forces:
- **EBENEZER SCROOGE** (AC 16, HP 75) - The Big Bad himself!
- **FROSTBITE** (AC 14, HP 30) - Polar bear lieutenant
- **6 GINGERBREAD GUARDS** (AC 12, HP 15 each) - Candy cane crossbows
- **2-3 GREMLINS** (AC 12, HP 7 each) - Guarding coat check

#### Enemy Positions:
- **Scrooge:** Center stage, addressing hostages (50 ft from entrance)
- **Frostbite:** Near hostages, ready to threaten them (40 ft from entrance)
- **Gingerbread Guards:** Scattered around perimeter with crossbows
- **Gremlins:** Coat check area (east entrance)

#### Tactical Situation:
- **Scrooge has The List on his belt** - if players can steal it NOW, they win a major objective early!
- Hostages are clustered tight - any AOE risks hitting them
- Scrooge will use hostages as leverage: *"One step closer and I'll turn them ALL into nutcrackers!"*
- If combat begins, Scrooge focuses on escaping with The List (his priority)
- **Victory Condition:** Defeat/capture Scrooge = automatic surrender of all other enemies
- **Scrooge's Escape:** At 25 HP or if things go badly, he teleports away toward Clock Tower

#### Rewards for Success:
- Recover The List immediately (one objective complete!)
- All hostages freed early (including Santa and Mrs. Claus)
- Player gear from coat check recovered
- Scrooge forced to flee to Clock Tower early

#### Risks:
- Hostages may be hurt or used as shields
- Very difficult fight (75+ HP worth of enemies)
- If Scrooge escapes, he still has The List

---

### COMBAT OPTION 2: LATER ASSAULT (After 9:00 PM)
**After Scrooge Leaves - Standard Difficulty**

**This is the recommended approach** - easier fight, less risk to hostages.

#### Enemy Forces:
- **FROSTBITE** (AC 14, HP 30) - Left in charge
- **6 GINGERBREAD GUARDS** (AC 12, HP 15 each) - Watching hostages
- **2 GREMLINS** (AC 12, HP 7 each) - Guarding coat check

#### Enemy Positions:
- **Frostbite:** Center near hostages, alert but bored (40 ft from entrance)
- **Gingerbread Guards:** Perimeter patrol & coat check
- **Gremlins:** Coat check, playing with confiscated items

#### Tactical Situation:
- Scrooge is gone with The List (must be recovered later)
- Guards are less organized without Scrooge
- Frostbite will threaten hostages if cornered: *"Back off or the cookies get it!"*
- Gremlins flee immediately if combat starts
- **Victory Condition:** Defeat Frostbite = other guards surrender

#### Tactical Approaches:
- **Stealth Entry:** Via chimney from Santa's Office (surprise round!)
- **Distraction:** Create diversion elsewhere, sneak in during chaos
- **Negotiation:** Frostbite can be reasoned with (DC 18 Persuasion/Intimidation)
- **Direct Assault:** Fight your way in (standard combat)

#### Rewards for Success:
- All hostages freed (Santa and Mrs. Claus can help!)
- Player gear from coat check recovered (optional heist minigame)
- Santa provides intel about Scrooge's location
- Mrs. Claus joins party as mobile ally (can provide healing cookies)

---

### GENERAL TACTICAL NOTES (Both Options):
- Stealth entry via chimney grants surprise round
- Can use Puppet Strings or Nutcracker toys strategically (if obtained from Vault)
- Chandeliers can be dropped on enemies (3d6 damage, 10 ft radius)
- Christmas tree is flammable (creates hazard if ignited)
- Tables can be flipped for instant full cover
- Coat Check is adjacent room - see optional heist minigame below

---

### OPTION 3: SCROOGE RETURNS (Improvised Finale)
**When Time Runs Out or Players Skip Clock Tower**

If players are taking too long, defeating many enemies across the workshop, or bypassing the Clock Tower entirely, **Scrooge can return to Grand Hall for a dramatic final showdown.**

#### When to Use This:
- Players spent so much time elsewhere that it's past 11:30 PM
- They've defeated most of his crew (Frostbite, lieutenants, etc.)
- They're approaching Grand Hall after securing other objectives
- You want to collapse the finale location to where it all began
- The Clock Tower approach isn't working for your table's pacing

#### Scrooge's Entrance:
Scrooge teleports into the Grand Hall in a cloud of coal dust, furious and desperate:

*"ENOUGH! You've destroyed my crew, ruined my plans, and wasted my TIME! If you want your precious hostages and your foolish List, you'll have to go through ME! This ends NOW!"*

#### Modified Arena:
- Hostages are still present (limiting AOE)
- All the original hazards and cover still apply
- Adds dramatic tension - save Christmas AND the hostages
- Can use chandelier drops, fireplace, Christmas tree as weapons

#### Why This Works:
- Returns the action to where it started (full circle moment)
- Hostages add stakes and pressure
- Familiar environment for players who started here
- Allows DM to skip Clock Tower if time is short
- Creates "Die Hard in the lobby" finale energy

#### DM Note:
This was improvised in actual play and worked beautifully. Players felt the urgency of protecting hostages while fighting the boss. The familiar room became the final battleground, bringing everything full circle. Use this when your session needs to wrap up or when players have taken an unexpected path that skips the Clock Tower.

---

### OPTIONAL: The Coat Check Heist

**Important:** Don't let players recover this gear easily! The makeshift weapons are half the fun. However, if players are really determined and want to attempt a risky heist, you can allow it as a high-stakes side mission.

#### THE SETUP:
Coat Check is adjacent to Grand Hall (east entrance), currently guarded by:
- **Frostbite** (AC 14, HP 30) - Alert but focused on the hostages
- **2 Gremlins** (AC 12, HP 7 each) - Distracted, playing with confiscated items

#### THE HEIST (3-Round Stealth Puzzle):

**Round 1 - Approach (DC 15 Stealth):**
- Success: Reach coat check door undetected
- Failure: Frostbite's ears twitch, he's suspicious (+2 DC to next check)
- Critical Failure: Spotted immediately, combat begins

**Round 2 - Distraction (Group Check DC 13):**
Players must create a distraction to draw attention away. Options:
- Throw shiny ornament for gremlins (auto-success if they have one)
- Make noise elsewhere (Deception/Performance)
- Use magic creatively (DM discretion)

Success: Frostbite investigates, players have window
Failure: Frostbite stays put, must try different approach or risk combat

**Round 3 - The Grab (DC 14 Sleight of Hand or Stealth):**
- Success: Each player grabs ONE signature item (not full loadout!)
- Partial Success (10-13): Grab items but make noise, must flee immediately
- Failure: Frostbite roars and attacks, full combat

#### CONSEQUENCES:
- **Success**: Players each recover ONE signature item (weapon, focus, or tool - their choice)
- **Detected**: Frostbite + 2 gremlins pursue, raising alarm (attracts 1d4 more gingerbread guards in 2 rounds)
- **Combat**: If forced to fight Frostbite here, he can call for backup (hostages in danger!)

#### DM NOTES:
- Make this feel risky and tense, not easy
- Even on success, they get ONE item each, not everything
- The makeshift weapons should still be valuable and fun
- Consider this a "reward for boldness" rather than intended path
- If they trigger combat, hostages may be threatened as leverage
- Timing matters: attempting this late (after 10 PM) is easier as Frostbite is less focused

#### Example Signature Items Recovered:
- Ginger gets "Frostbrand" longsword back
- Holly gets her thieves' tools
- Peppermint gets peppermint staff (arcane focus)
- Jolly gets full tinker's tools kit
- Northy gets longbow + arrows
- Cinnamon gets druidic focus pendant

## 2. MAINTENANCE HALLWAY (Starting Location)

![Maintenance Hallway](../assets/images/2-l1-maintenance-hall.png)

**Size:** 40×10 ft, 12 ft ceiling  
**Width:** Narrow 2-wide corridor  
**Enemies:** None (starting location)

### Cover:
- Tool boxes (half)
- Maintenance locker (half)
- Steam vents (obscurement)

### Hazards:
- Steam pipes (cut for fog cloud effect)
- Narrow corridor (difficult combat)

### Key Features:
- Starting equipment here
- Vents to multiple floors
- Service elevator (loud if rushed)

### Description:
Narrow service corridor with exposed copper pipes hissing with magical steam. Flickering enchanted bulbs cast dim blue-green light. Metal tool boxes line both walls. Open maintenance locker with tools spilling out. Steam vents create mist. Concrete floor with debris. A small grimy window looks out toward the Grand Hall (you can see the hostage situation but can't reach it directly from here). The hallway extends north - a long stretch to the Loading Dock.

### Specialist Knowledge:

**JOLLY:** You know the steam pipes carry magical energy - cutting one creates a 10 ft fog cloud. The vents lead to multiple floors (you've crawled through them before). The service elevator is quiet if you go slow, but LOUD if rushed. There's usually a Master Key hidden in maintenance areas (check the locker carefully). The small window overlooks Grand Hall but there's no direct access - you'd need to go through other rooms or find another route.

**GINGER:** You know this hallway is in the back service area. The long corridor north leads to Loading Dock (about 80 feet away through the service passage). Assembly Floor is east. Service elevator is west. There's no direct route to Grand Hall from here - the window lets you see in but you'd have to navigate through Loading Dock or other areas to reach it. The vent system bypasses locked doors - tight squeeze but doable. Security cameras are in corners (currently offline from alarm). The service elevator triggers silent alarm if used without key card.

### Starting Loot (No Check Required):
- The Tool Belt: Wrench, pliers, screwdrivers (Thieves' Tools AND Tinker's Tools)
- The Gardener's Pouch: Mistletoe and dried holly (Druidic Focus)
- The Foreman's Badge: Heavy iron gear symbol (Holy Symbol)
- Safety Box Cutter: 1d4 slashing, light weapon
- Fire Extinguisher: Creates fog cloud effect, 3 uses
- Maintenance Ladder: Can reach vents, 10 ft
- Duct Tape & Wire: For crafting/repairs, advantage on improvised repairs

### Path Options:
- **North:** Loading Dock
- **South:** Vents that access multiple floors (requires ladder)
- **West:** Service elevator (DC 13 Stealth or attracts 2 gremlins)

---

## 3. LOADING DOCK

![Loading Dock](../assets/images/3-l1-loading-dock.png)

**Size:** 60×40 ft, 20 ft ceiling  
**Present Maze:** Stacks of wrapped presents create maze  
**Enemies:** 2 Gingerbread Thugs + 3 Gremlins

### Cover:
- Present stacks (full, 6 ft tall)
- Toy wagon (half)
- Wooden crates (full)

### Hazards:
- Bay door (fall 10 ft to outside)
- Cargo hooks overhead (can drop)
- Slippery loading ramp

### Key Features:
- Walkie-talkie loot (Scrooge taunts)
- Intel clue about vault/bomb timeline
- Holly navigates maze without checks (her territory)

### Enemy Starting Positions:
- **Gumball:** Center by shipping crate (30 ft from entrance)
- **Licorice:** Near bay door (40 ft from entrance)
- **Gremlins:** Scattered among presents (2 east, 1 west)

### Description:
Large bay doors open to snowy landscape. Colorful wrapped gifts stacked tall creating maze-like piles. Wooden crates with coiled rope. Red toy wagon by wall. Loading ramp leads outside. Overhead chains with hooks. Industrial lights. Gremlin footprints in snow.

### Specialist Knowledge:

**HOLLY:** This is your territory. You know the gift stacks are organized by route - you can navigate the maze without checks. Heavy boxes on top shelves can be tipped onto enemies (just need to know which stack). The toy wagon by the wall can fit a person and rolls FAST down the loading ramp. Snow shovels are kept by the door - sturdy metal, good improvised weapons.

**NORTHY:** You load the sleigh here constantly. The loading ramp is slippery when wet - enemies might slip (but so could you). There's a sleigh brake release lever that could drop a loaded cargo sled. The rope used for tying down cargo is rated for 1000+ lbs. Fresh snow outside means tracks - you can track where enemies went.

**GINGER:** You patrol this area nightly. The bay door controls are on the east wall (can trap enemies inside/outside). There's a blind spot behind the present stacks (northeast corner). The loading dock camera is on the north wall (currently offline). The external door lock can be engaged from inside (prevent reinforcements).

### Enemy Encounter:

**GUMBALL & LICORICE** - Gingerbread Thugs (AC 12, HP 15 each)
- Armed with candy cane clubs (1d6+2)
- On guard duty, arguing about their cut
- Dialogue: *"I'm tellin' ya, Licorice, we shoulda been vault crew!"* / *"Shut it, Gumball, or I'll crumb you myself!"*

**SPARK, WRENCH, & GIZMO** - Gremlins (AC 12, HP 7 each)
- Chittering and trying to steal shiny ornaments from presents
- Bite attacks (+4, 1d4+2)
- Advantage if 2+ gremlins on same target

**Stealth Check:** DC 13 to avoid detection

### Important Loot:
**Walkie-Talkie** (dropped by Gumball) - Scrooge will taunt players periodically!

**Scrooge's Radio Banter:** *"I see you've found my gingerbread men. A pity they weren't smarter. But then, neither are you if you think you can stop me. Bah! Humbug!"*

### Makeshift Equipment:
- Heavy gift boxes (drop for 2d6 damage, improvised cover)
- Shipping rope (50 ft, create traps)
- Toy wagon (ride down ramps for quick escape)
- Snow shovel (improvised weapon, 1d6 bludgeoning)
- Ornament boxes (throw for distraction - gremlins LOVE shiny things)

### Intel Clue:
Players overhear: *"Boss wants the vault opened by 10 PM"* and *"Bomb on the sleigh set for midnight. Charlie's gonna wire it up something fierce!"*

**Gremlin Behavior:** Flee at 3 HP or less, chittering in fear. Cowards individually but dangerous in groups.

## 4. MAIN ASSEMBLY FLOOR

![Main Assembly Floor](../assets/images/4-l1-assembly-floor.png)

**Size:** 80×60 ft, 25 ft ceiling  
**Catwalks:** 15 ft above ground level  
**Enemies:** Gingersnap + 2 Gremlins (on shoulders)

### Cover:
- Workbenches (half)
- Machinery (full)
- Toy crates (half/full depending on size)

### Hazards:
- **TOY CRUSHER** (4d6 damage + restrain DC 15 Str)
- Conveyor belts (sweep 20 ft/round toward crusher)
- Mechanical arms (can grab/restrain)
- Oil slicks (difficult terrain)

### Key Features:
- Master Key under foreman's desk
- Can reverse conveyor controls
- Reprogram mechanical arm #3 (DC 14 Tinker's Tools)

### Enemy Starting Positions:
- **Gingersnap:** Center patrol, figure-8 pattern (40 ft from entrance)
- **BYTE:** On Gingersnap's left shoulder
- **CLICK:** On Gingersnap's right shoulder

### Description:
Massive factory floor with three wide conveyor belts moving wooden toys and dolls. Mechanical robotic arms assembling products. Workbenches cluttered with tools and toy parts. Toy crusher with grinding gears at far end. Metal catwalks overhead. Oil puddles on concrete floor. Stacked crates. Overhead lights illuminate gears and pistons.

### Specialist Knowledge:

**JOLLY:** This is YOUR domain. You know every inch. The main conveyor belt leads directly to the Toy Crusher (you can reverse it with panel behind foreman's desk). Mechanical arm #3 can be reprogrammed to grab/restrain (DC 14 Tinker's Tools - easy for you!). There's a MASTER KEY hidden under the foreman's desk drawer (you put it there for emergencies). The emergency stop button is behind red panel on east wall. Oil from sabotaged machines creates slippery patches. The crusher does 4d6 damage - you've seen it destroy defective toys instantly. Wind-up toy soldiers in bin #7 still work.

**GINGER:** You've patrolled this floor countless times. The catwalks above provide high ground and cover. The northwest corner is a blind spot (good for ambush). The crusher's safety override is on the south wall (emergency access). You know the patrol pattern guards usually use here.

### Environmental Hazards:
- Active conveyor belts (DC 12 Dex save or swept toward THE TOY CRUSHER)
- THE TOY CRUSHER: 4d6 bludgeoning + DC 15 Str save to avoid being pulled in
- Mechanical arms (reprogram with DC 14 Tinker check to grab enemies)
- Oil slicks from gremlin sabotage (difficult terrain)

### Enemy Encounter:

**GINGERSNAP** - Elite stale gingerbread enforcer (AC 14, HP 30)
- Armed with toy blaster (reflavored hand crossbow, 1d6+3)
- Patrols in pattern (Perception DC 15 to map)
- Missing one gumdrop eye (wears makeshift eye patch)
- Dialogue: *"Factory's mine now. Anyone tries to stop this, they're getting CRUMBLED."*

**BYTE & CLICK** (AC 12, HP 7 each) - Gremlins riding on Gingersnap's shoulders
- Throw gears and screws as weapons
- Chittering: *"Crumbled! Crumbled!"*

**Patrol Route:** Walks figure-8 pattern around machinery

### Makeshift Equipment:
- Toy hammer (improvised maul, 1d8 bludgeoning, two-handed)
- Building blocks (caltrops, d4 damage, slows movement)
- Wind-up toy soldiers (12 total - distraction, march in formation)
- Mechanical arm controls (can program to grab/restrain)
- Wrench (improvised club, 1d6 bludgeoning)

### Secret:
Under the foreman's desk is a **Master Key** to most workshop doors (Investigation DC 15, or Jolly knows it's there automatically).

**Tactical Note:** Force enemies onto conveyor belt toward crusher for environmental kills!

## 5. GIFT WRAPPING STATION (Safe Zone)

![Gift Wrapping Station](../assets/images/10-l1-gift-wrapping.png)

**Size:** 30×30 ft, 12 ft ceiling  
**Safe Zone:** No enemies  
**Equipment:** Abundant crafting materials

### Cover:
- Wrapping tables (half)
- Ribbon spools stacked (full)
- Paper racks (half)

### Key Features:
- Wrapping tubes (quarterstaffs)
- Ribbon (100 ft rope equivalent)
- Scissors (daggers)
- Glitter bombs (blind DC 13)
- Tape (grease trap effect)

### Description:
Festive chaos of ribbons, bows, and wrapping paper in every pattern. Colorful paper rolls on wall racks. Industrial-sized ribbon spools in red, green, and gold hanging from ceiling. Wrapping tables with scissors, tape, bows. Glitter bomb boxes on shelves. Paper tubes. Bright overhead lighting. Organized chaos in Christmas colors.

### No Enemies:
Safe zone for now - use this to regroup and gear up!

### GHOST OF CHRISTMAS PRESENT:
As players search the room, they notice a wrapped present that wasn't there a moment ago. When opened, it contains useful improvised equipment (DM's choice - perhaps extra glitter bombs, reinforced wrapping tubes, or enchanted ribbon). The scent of evergreen fills the air and faint sleigh bells jingle in the distance.

### Makeshift Equipment:
- **Wrapping paper tubes** (quarterstaffs, 1d6 bludgeoning, versatile 1d8)
- **Ribbon spools** (100 ft of rope-like material, strong enough to bind)
- **Scissors** (improvised daggers, 1d4 piercing)
- **Glitter bombs** (creates blinding effect, DC 13 Con save or blinded 1 round)
- **Double-sided tape strips** (improvised glue/grease trap)

### Intel Clue:
Wrapping schedule shows special "DO NOT WRAP" items going to the vault tonight - the heist was planned in advance!

---

## 6. SLEIGH HANGAR

![Sleigh Hangar](../assets/images/5-l3-sleigh-hanger.png)

**Size:** 70×50 ft, 40 ft ceiling  
**Catwalk:** 15 ft above ground  
**Enemies:** Charlie + Patty + 2 Gremlins + **THE BOMB**

### Cover:
- Sleigh (huge, full cover)
- Supply crates (half)
- Workbenches (half)
- Reindeer harnesses (concealment)

### Hazards:
- **THE BOMB** (don't damage it!)
- Polish spills (DC 13 Dex save vs fall)
- Bay door (30 ft drop to outside)

### THE BOMB - Logic Puzzle:
**4 wires visible:** Red, Green, Blue, Gold

**GHOST OF CHRISTMAS YET TO COME:** As players approach the bomb, an icy wind blows through the hangar despite no windows being open. For a brief moment, they glimpse a vision of the sleigh exploding in flames, the workshop in ruins, children waking to empty stockings. The shadow fades, leaving only urgency and determination. The future is not yet written.

**CLUE FOUND EARLIER:** Scrawled note says *"Old Scrooge hates green (reminds him of money he lost), loves gold (all he cares about)"*

**SOLUTION:**
- **GOLD = Disarmed safely** ✓
- **Blue** = Nothing happens, wire is dummy
- **Red** = Bomb timer speeds up! Now 10 minutes instead of remaining time
- **Green** = BOOM! 8d6 fire damage, 30 ft radius, DC 15 Dex save for half

**Alternative:** DC 18 Tinker's Tools check to manually disarm without cutting wires

### Enemy Starting Positions:
- **Charlie:** Under sleigh, working on bomb (center, 35 ft from entrance)
- **Patty:** Standing guard near sleigh's left side, crossbow ready (30 ft from entrance)
- **TICK:** Sitting on sleigh watching timer
- **TOCK:** Perched on supply crate, fidgeting with wires

### Description:
Massive vaulted chamber housing Santa's ornate red and gold sleigh with curved runners. Open skylight shows starry night and moon. Reindeer harnesses hang on wooden pegs along walls. Workbenches with tools and polish barrels. Metal catwalk above. Supply crates in corners. Crude bomb with visible wires strapped under sleigh. Vaulted stone ceiling with wooden beams. Magical glow emanates from sleigh. Snowy landing pad visible through opening.

### Specialist Knowledge:

**NORTHY:** This is YOUR hangar. You prep the sleigh every Christmas Eve. You know exactly where the bomb is placed (undercarriage, near fuel line - VERY dangerous). The reindeer harnesses on wall can support 2000+ lbs (excellent for climbing/rescue). That polish is slippery as ice when spilled (you've fallen before). The flight goggles on workbench have night vision (magical enchantment). Reindeer feed in barrel grants temporary flight magic. You can call the reindeer from stables with whistle hanging by door. The sleigh's emergency brake is the red lever on left side.

**HOLLY:** You load this sleigh constantly. The gift compartments are organized by continental route (might be useful info). The sleigh can fit 6 people comfortably (escape route?). The bells aren't just decorative - they create magical sound waves when rung (alarm/weapon?). You know the sleigh requires Santa's voice command to start ('Up, up, and away!').

**GINGER:** You've secured this hangar for years. The hangar doors can be sealed from inside (prevent aerial reinforcements). There's a catwalk above with good overwatch position. Emergency exit is behind supply closet (west wall). That bomb is military-grade - handle with extreme care.

### Enemy Encounter:

**COAL-HEART CHARLIE** (AC 13, HP 18) - Burnt gingerbread demolitions expert
- Giggles constantly: *"Hehehehe... red wire, green wire, BOOM wire!"*
- Has dead man's switch - if killed suddenly, might trigger bomb
- Improvised weapons ~1d6 damage

**PEPPERMINT PATTY** (AC 13, HP 18) - Former elf archer
- Cold and precise: *"Shut up, Charlie, and hand me the timer!"*
- Candy cane crossbow (+5 to hit, 1d8+3 piercing)

**TICK & TOCK** (AC 12, HP 7 each) - Gremlins obsessed with bomb timer
- Will trigger bomb if combat goes poorly (everyone must flee!)
- Can be distracted with shiny ornaments (DC 13 Deception/Persuasion)

### Makeshift Equipment:
- Reindeer harnesses (improvised rope, lasso with advantage on grapple)
- Sleigh bells (create loud distraction/alarm, heard throughout workshop)
- **Reindeer feed** - Magical berries (4 portions - grant temporary flying 30 ft for 1 minute when eaten)
- Polish and rags (create 10 ft slippery surface, DC 13 Dex save)
- Flight goggles (advantage on Perception checks, look cool)

**Critical:** If bomb isn't disarmed by 11:30 PM, sleigh is destroyed and Christmas is ruined!

**Scrooge Taunt on Radio:** *"Tick tock, heroes. Time is money, and you're wasting both! Bah!"*

---

## 7. CLOCK TOWER (Final Boss Arena)

![Clock Tower](../assets/images/6-l3-clock-tower.png)

**Size:** 50×50 ft circular, 60 ft tall  
**Platforms:** Multiple levels at 20 ft and 40 ft  
**Enemies:** Slush (first), then SCROOGE

### Cover:
- Massive gears (full, rotating)
- Stone pillars (full)
- Pendulum (swings, no stable cover)

### Hazards:
- Gears (2d6 damage + restrain DC 14 Str)
- Pendulum (2d8 damage + prone DC 13 Str)
- Bells (deafen DC 13 Con)
- Ice patches from Slush
- Clock hands (can knock off platforms)
- Falls of 30+ ft

### Key Features:
- Time dilation oil (Slow spell effect)
- Can redirect pendulum at enemies
- Cut bell rope to drop bells (4d6 damage)
- Heating controls can be reactivated

### Enemy Starting Position:
**Slush:** Upper platform (40 ft level), actively sabotaging heating system

### Description:
Interior of massive magical clock tower. Enormous bronze gears the size of carriages rotating with precision. Giant pendulum swinging through center. Wooden platforms at multiple heights connected by metal ladders. Huge clock mechanism with glowing runes. Ice crystals forming on metal surfaces. Massive bells at top. Clock face shows transparent view of starry night outside. Steam and frost mix in air. Copper pipes and pistons. Blue-white glow from enchanted clockwork. Vertigo-inducing height. Steampunk Christmas aesthetic.

### GHOST OF CHRISTMAS YET TO COME:
A cloaked shadow briefly appears on the upper platform, pointing at the damaged gears with one skeletal hand - a warning of the danger. When Scrooge arrives for the final confrontation, the shadow appears again, gesturing toward Scrooge and then touching its chest where a heart would be: "He can still be saved..." As time runs short, clock chimes echo louder than they should, and the wind picks up: "Hurry... the future is not yet written..."

### Specialist Knowledge:

**JOLLY:** You've maintained this clock for years - you know it intimately. The pendulum chain can support 500 lbs (you've tested it for safety). Gear teeth can be broken off as caltrops (you know which gears are replaceable). The time dilation oil has magical slow properties. The bells will deafen everyone if rung manually (you know the warning protocol). Ice on gears means heating system sabotage (panel behind north gear). You can restart heating with red valve on east wall. The mechanism can be weaponized - redirect pendulum to swing at enemies. Emergency stop behind access panel (but stopping clock stops Christmas!).

**GINGER:** You've patrolled this tower countless times. The catwalks provide excellent tactical positions. The bell rope can be cut to drop bells on enemies below (4d6 damage). There's a maintenance ladder to the roof (escape route). Slush's ice patches are dangerous - watch your footing.

### Enemy Encounter - SLUSH (Master Saboteur):

**SLUSH** (AC 15, HP 35) - The melting snowman saboteur
- Constantly dripping, leaving puddles (difficult terrain)
- Armed with icicle daggers (1d6+3 piercing) and frost magic
- Will try to damage clock mechanism to delay launch
- Knows parkour - uses environment, slides on own ice trails
- Can cast: Ice Knife, Fog Cloud, Hold Person
- Melting laugh: *"Time's up for Christmas... literally! **drip drip**"*

### SCROOGE ARRIVAL:
After Slush is defeated, Scrooge arrives (climbs from stairwell or teleports in coal dust):

*"Ah, the heroes arrive. Too late, I'm afraid. In moments, this clock will stop forever. No midnight, no launch, no Christmas. The children will wake to NOTHING!"*

### Environmental Hazards:
- Moving gears (DC 14 Dex save or 2d6 bludgeoning + restrained between gears)
- Clock hands (move slowly but can knock players off platforms, DC 12 Str save or fall 30 ft)
- Bells (if rung manually, deafens everyone in room for 1 minute, DC 13 Con save)
- Ice patches from Slush (difficult terrain, DC 12 Acrobatics or fall prone)

### Makeshift Equipment:
- Clock pendulum chain (improvised flail, 1d8 bludgeoning, reach)

**Size:** 40×40 ft, 20 ft ceiling  
**Padded walls:** Foam and rubber surfaces  
**Enemies:** Frost Twins + Tinsel + 2 Gremlins

### Cover:
- Foam pit (full if hiding, 8 ft deep)
- Testing ramps (half)
- Toy crates (half)

### Hazards:
- Spring platforms (launch 15 ft, DC 12 Dex)
- Catapult (2d8 bludgeoning)
- Jack-in-boxes (frighten DC 14 Wis)

### Key Features:
- Jolly knows spring timing perfectly
- Foam pit is safe landing zone

Padded room with colorful foam pit filled with soft blocks. Spring-loaded platforms. Wooden testing ramps. Toy catapult apparatus. Scattered bouncy balls. Half-finished prototypes. Jack-in-boxes on shelves. Rubber band balls. Safety helmet rack. Padded mats. Bright testing lights overhead.

### Specialist Knowledge:

**JOLLY:** You oversee quality control here. You know the spring-loaded platforms launch at specific intervals (you know the timing). Testing catapult is calibrated for 50 lb loads (can definitely launch a gremlin). Jack-in-the-boxes are set to maximum spring tension (genuinely frightening). Foam pit is 8 feet deep (safe to jump into from height). The control panel on east wall operates all testing equipment. Rubber band ball has 2000+ rubber bands (serious projectile). Testing helmet passed all safety checks (actually protective!).

**GINGER:** You've responded to 'testing accidents' here. The padded walls muffle sound (good for stealth, bad for hearing threats). Emergency shut-off is by the door (red button). The foam pit conceals things well (good hiding spot).

### Enemy Encounter:

**THE FROST TWINS (Sleet & Hail)** (AC 11, HP 12 each)
- Matching scarves, work in perfect sync
- Sleet uses icicle daggers, Hail throws snowballs

**TINSEL** (AC 13, HP 20) - Fallen elf tinkerer in dark green

- Knows all the trap triggers
- Dialogue: *"Oh, you want to TEST yourselves against us? How delightful!"*

**PINCH & STEAL** (AC 12, HP 7 each) - Two gremlins

- Toy crossbow (actually works! 1d6+2 piercing, range 30/60)
- Rubber band ball (improvised sling ammunition, 10 shots)
- Testing helmet (grants +1 AC when worn, looks ridiculous)

**Tactics:** Tinsel activates springs and catapults. Frost Twins coordinate attacks. Gremlins sabotage player equipment if they get close.

### Enemy Encounter:

**EMBER & ASH** - Two corrupted gingerbread guards (burnt and blackened)
- AC 13, HP 22 each
- Resistant to fire damage
- Use fire-based attacks (2d6 fire damage)
- Eyes glow like hot coals
- **Ember:** *"Should've stayed in the oven..."*
- **Ash:** *"...where it's safe and BURNING HOT!"*

## 10. LEGENDARY TOY VAULT

![Legendary Toy Vault](../assets/images/7-l0-toy-vault.png)

**Size:** 40×30 ft + 15 ft corridor, 15 ft ceiling  
**Choke Point:** 10 ft wide entrance door  
**Enemies:** Frostbite + Grizzle + 2 Gingerbread + 4 Gremlins

### Cover:
- Shelves (full, 8 ft tall)
- Vault door (massive full cover)
- Wooden crates (half)

### Hazards:
- Pressure plates (200 lbs triggers alarm)
- Choke point entrance (tactical bottleneck)

### Key Features:
- 6 magical locks (3 broken at 9 PM, full breach 10 PM)
- Can seal vault from inside (trap enemies)
- Service tunnel from Coal Plant (stealth approach)

### Enemy Starting Positions:
- **Frostbite:** Just inside vault entrance, guarding (15 ft from corridor)
- **Grizzle:** At vault door mechanisms, drilling (10 ft from entrance)
- **Fudge:** Inside vault, examining toys on left shelf (25 ft from entrance)
- **Toffee:** Inside vault, examining toys on right shelf (25 ft from entrance)
- **Gremlins:** Scattered inside vault - 2 on floor grabbing toys, 2 climbing shelves

### Vault Status:
When players arrive, door is 50% open (3 of 6 locks broken at 9:00 PM). By 10:00 PM, vault is fully breached if not stopped.

### Description:
Reinforced vault chamber. Massive steel vault door half-open with glowing colored magical locks. Shelves lined with glowing legendary toys - nutcracker, dollhouse, teddy bear, snowglobe, toy soldiers. Drill equipment on stone floor. Magical runes glowing on walls and floor. Wooden crates. Reinforced stone walls. Christmas magic aura with multicolored ethereal glow. Basement dungeon meets magical workshop. Polar bears in dark armor. Gingerbread men drilling. Gremlins stuffing sacks with toys.

### Specialist Knowledge:

**GINGER:** You designed the security for this vault. You know it has 6 magical locks, each requiring different key (currently 3 broken by villains at 9:00 PM). Voice lock requires Santa's voice specifically (her voice, not just any 'Santa'). There's a manual override behind north panel (requires your security badge). The vault door can be sealed from INSIDE (trap enemies in if needed). You know the guard rotation schedule (but it's disrupted by heist). Pressure plates inside trigger if more than 200 lbs removed at once (anti-theft). Emergency protocol: if vault is breached, alarms in Santa's office activate.

**JOLLY:** You helped BUILD some of these legendary toys. The Nutcracker General was your apprentice project (you know its command words). Toy Soldier Drum has special rhythm that summons more soldiers (you know it). The Train Set requires specific track layout to teleport (you know the pattern). Some toys are more stable than others (Dollhouse is safest, Puppet Strings most dangerous). You know which toys are single-use vs reusable (most are single-use to prevent misuse).

**PEPPERMINT:** You enchanted several of these items. Jack Frost's Snowglobe contains concentrated winter magic (handle carefully!). The Eternal Top manipulates time magic (very unstable if misused). Teddy Bear of Protection has fey magic woven in (requires attunement). You can identify which toys do what by their magical aura (no testing needed). Crystal storage here is more powerful than normal (can hold 3rd level spell).

### Enemy Encounter:

**FROSTBITE** (AC 14, HP 30) - Massive polar bear lieutenant
- Sniffs air menacingly: *"Silence. I smell... heroes."*
- Ice breath weapon (15 ft cone, 3d6 cold, DC 13 Con save for half)
- Can cast Counterspell once (ice magic, shuts down spells)

**GRIZZLE** (AC 13, HP 25) - Disgruntled polar bear brute
- Keeps drilling: *"Keep drilling! Boss wants this open NOW!"*
- Claw attacks (2d6+3 slashing)

**FUDGE & TOFFEE** (AC 12, HP 15 each) - Two gingerbread vault crackers
- Using tools to crack locks
- Armed with improvised weapons (wrenches, pry bars)

**NIBBLE, GRAB, SNATCH, & POCKET** (AC 12, HP 7 each) - Four gremlins
- Stuffing vault items into bags
- Will flee with loot if combat goes badly

### Player Options:
- Fight now while outnumbered but vault mostly secure
- Sneak in and steal legendary toys before villains finish (DC 15 Stealth)
- Sabotage their tools (DC 14 Sleight of Hand or Tinker's Tools)
- Lock them IN the vault if they win (DC 16 Tinker's Tools to reverse locks)

### LEGENDARY TOYS IN VAULT:
**(Each works ONCE only - single use!)**

- **The Nutcracker General** (summon warrior, 40 HP, +6 to hit, 2d6+3 damage, fights for 10 minutes)
- **Dollhouse of Dimension** (creates 10×10 ft extradimensional safe space for 1 hour)
- **Toy Soldier Regiment Drum** (summons 20 toy soldiers, 5 HP each, +4 to hit, 1d6+2 damage, last 10 minutes)
- **The Eternal Top** (spin to cast Slow in 20 ft radius for 1 minute, no concentration)
- **Teddy Bear of Protection** (grants bearer 20 temp HP and resistance to all damage for 10 minutes)
- **Train Set of Teleportation** (can teleport party to any workshop location they've visited once)
- **The Puppet Master's Strings** (control one humanoid for 1 minute, DC 15 Wis save)
- **Jack Frost's Snowglobe** (cast Cone of Cold once - 8d8 cold damage, 60 ft cone, DC 16 Dex save for half)

**Note:** Each legendary toy is SINGLE USE. Players should choose wisely and save for final fight!

**CRITICAL:** The Naughty & Nice List is NOT here - Scrooge took it at 8:00 PM from the Grand Hall party. It now hangs from his belt!

**Scrooge Radio Taunt:** *"My my, you've reached my vault crew. How... industrious. But you're too late. I already have what I came for. The List is mine!"*

## 11. PAINT & ENCHANTMENT WORKSHOP (Safe Zone)

![Paint & Enchantment Workshop](../assets/images/11-l2-paint-enchant-workshop.png)

**Size:** 35×25 ft, 12 ft ceiling  
**Safe Zone:** Unless players are loud (DC 14 Stealth)  
**Enemies:** None initially, but magical security triggers on loud noises

### Cover:
- Workbenches (half)
- Storage cabinets (full)
- Mixing station (half)

### Hazards:
- Security triggers loud alarm if players fail stealth
- Paint explosions if vials broken

### ENCHANTED PAINT VIALS:
**(8 colors, each has different effect)**

- **RED:** Fire damage (2d6, splash weapon)
- **BLUE:** Ice/freezing (restrains target, DC 13 Str save)
- **GREEN:** Healing potion (2d4+2 HP)
- **YELLOW:** Lightning burst (1d8 damage, can arc to second target)
- **PURPLE:** Sleep effect (DC 13 Wis save or fall asleep)
- **ORANGE:** Haste effect (extra action for 1 minute)
- **SILVER:** Invisibility (1 minute)
- **GOLD:** Resistance to damage (10 minutes)

### Key Features:
- Mix palette (combine paint effects safely)
- Crystal storage (can hold one spell)
- Peppermint knows combinations and can disable security

### Description:
Mystical workstation where toys receive final magical touches. Shelves lined with glowing vials of colored paint - red, orange, yellow, green, blue, purple, silver, gold. Enchantment workbench with mystical tools. Paint brushes and mixing palettes. Glowing magical runes on walls and floor. Crystal storage units. Soft multicolored glow from magical paints. Stone floor with painted rune circles.

### Specialist Knowledge:

**PEPPERMINT:** This is YOUR workshop. You calibrated these arrays yourself. You know exactly which paint color does what by the glow pattern (no need to test). The mixing palette can combine paint effects (you know which combinations are safe). Red + Yellow = explosion (dangerous!), Blue + Green = healing mist (useful!). The silver paint creates true invisibility (not just concealment). The purple paint's sleep effect works on constructs too (unlike most sleep magic). Crystal storage unit can hold ONE spell for later (you've done this before). The magical security activates on loud noises - DC 14 Stealth or it triggers. You can disable the security with the rune sequence (top right, bottom left, center).

**CINNAMON:** The magical energy here resonates with natural magic. Green paint is actually distilled plant essence (very potent healing). The runes on walls stabilize wild magic (advantage on concentration checks here). You sense the orange paint has haste properties (time magic, nature-adjacent).

### No Enemies Initially:
But magical security activates if players are too loud (DC 14 Stealth check)

### Other Equipment:
- Paint brushes (improvised wands for spellcasters)
- Mixing palette (can combine paint effects with DM approval)

**Special:** Spellcasters can use the enchanted paints as substitute spell components with DM creativity!

Mixing bowls, rolling pins, cast iron skillets. Herbs hanging from ceiling. Warm inviting oven lighting. Flour sacks. Cinnamon and spice jars. Cozy yet industrial feel.

### Specialist Knowledge:

**GINGER:** You were literally BAKED in this kitchen. You know Mrs. Claus is a master baker and quite formidable (don't underestimate her). The gingerbread recipe is in the blue book on shelf (your origin story!). Cast iron pans are heirloom quality - extremely durable weapons. The ovens reach 500°F (dangerous if pushed into - 4d6 fire damage). Secret pantry behind spice rack (extra supplies). Mrs. Claus's 'special ingredients' shelf has magical properties.

### Ally Encounter - MRS. CLAUS:

**Read Aloud:**
You cautiously enter the kitchen and find Mrs. Claus - alive and free! She's at the counter, already preparing something.

*"Thank goodness!"* she exclaims. *"When those gremlins got distracted by the shiny ornaments on my apron, I slipped away. I saw what happened - that dreadful Scrooge has my wife and everyone else. But I won't let him win."*

She's already baking enhanced healing cookies, the air filled with cinnamon and magic.

### GHOST OF CHRISTMAS PRESENT:
As players enter, the oven fire burns extra bright with warm firelight. The scent of evergreen mingles with cinnamon and cocoa. Mrs. Claus looks surprised: *"How strange... I seem to have MORE cookies than I thought I made. It's as if someone blessed my baking..."* Faint sleigh bells can be heard, though no sleigh is near. The spirit of abundance and fellowship fills the room.

### Mrs. Claus Provides:

### Mrs. Claus's Special Item:
**Naughty List Detector** - Compass that points toward nearest villain (within 100 ft)

**Important Note:** This is a SAFE ZONE and excellent place for a breather before the big pushes!

- **Shadow Soot** x3 (invisible in shadows 10 minutes each)
- **Spirit's Mirror** (shows happiest memory - USE IN FINAL FIGHT!)

### SERVICE TUNNEL:
Leads directly behind Vault (stealth approach!)

### Key Features:
Grants advantage on Persuasion to redeem Scrooge if players reference these items

### Description:
Dark coal processing plant with Victorian counting desk covered in bitter letters and ledgers. Coal chutes and processing equipment. Barrels of coal for naughty list. Scattered coal pieces on stone floor. Chains hanging from walls. Dim overhead industrial light. Sooty walls. Scrooge's personal effects - money staff, spectral chains, Christmas card from Tiny Tim. Spirit of Christmas Past mirror on wall. Coal dust in air. Melancholy abandoned workspace. Basement dungeon aesthetic.

### Specialist Knowledge:

**GINGER:** You know this room's history. It was sealed 20 years ago after... an incident (Scrooge's first arrival). The service tunnel leads directly behind Vault (perfect stealth approach). This was where 'special cases' were brought for rehabilitation (usually unsuccessful). You've never been inside, but you know layout from security blueprints. The chains on wall are enchanted (similar to ones Scrooge wears now).

**PEPPERMINT:** You sense residual magic. Dark emotions have soaked into this place (despair, bitterness, greed). The mirror on wall isn't ordinary - it's tied to memory magic. Scrooge's presence left a magical 'stain' here (you can trace his emotional journey). The chains are spectral binding magic (designed to show regrets).

**JOLLY:** You know the coal processing mechanics. The chutes lead to multiple locations (including Loading Dock). Coal quality here is poorest (reserved for 'naughty' deliveries). The desk looks out of place - someone moved it here deliberately. Service tunnel is structurally sound despite age.

### No Enemies:
But evidence of Scrooge's tragic backstory and motivation

### Special Equipment (The Naughty Arsenal):
- Scrooge's Money-Counting Staff (magical quarterstaff, 1d8+1 bludgeoning, grants +2 to Persuasion vs greedy creatures)
- Chains of Binding (magical chains Jacob Marley gave him, 30 ft, can restrain Large or smaller, DC 16 Str save)
- Coal Bomb (throwable, 15 ft radius, DC 15 Dex save or 4d6 fire damage)
- Shadow Soot (3 vials - grants invisibility in shadows/darkness for 10 minutes each)
- **The Spirit of Christmas Past's Mirror** (shows a creature's happiest Christmas memory, can be used to break Scrooge's resolve in final fight)

### Emotional Discovery:
Players find:
- Scrooge's ledgers showing he tried to be generous after his redemption
- Letters from people who took advantage of his generosity
- A final letter: *"I tried. I TRIED to be better. But the world doesn't change. People are selfish. Christmas is a LIE - temporary kindness that fades by New Year's. If Christmas has no lasting power, then it deserves to end. Let them see the truth I learned: generosity is weakness, and joy is fleeting. - E.S."*
- A faded Christmas card from Tiny Tim, signed *"God Bless Us, Every One"*
- Diary entries showing his slow descent back into bitterness over decades

### GHOST OF CHRISTMAS PAST:
When players find Tiny Tim's Christmas card, a warm golden glow suddenly illuminates it, as if a gentle hand were holding a candle nearby. The smell of old parchment and candlewax fills the dusty room. A child's voice whispers softly, filled with hope: *"He was kind once... he can be again..."* The light fades, but the card seems warmer to the touch, as if love still dwells within it.

**This Discovery Grants:** In final confrontation, players have advantage on Persuasion checks to redeem Scrooge if they reference these items and show him he's forgotten the TRUE meaning of Christmas - it's not about changing others, but changing yourself.

**Tactical Advantage:** Room has service tunnel that leads behind the Vault (perfect for ambush or stealth approach).

**Emotional Weight:** This room should feel sad, not scary. Scrooge is a tragedy, not a monster.
