## How to Run This Adventure

This is a fast, cinematic Christmas heist adventure designed for 3-4 hours of play. Players use makeshift weapons, creative tactics, and environmental combat to save Christmas from Scrooge and his corrupted crew. The core loop: gather intel and gear, complete 1-2 major objectives (stop the Vault heist, disarm the Sleigh bomb), then confront Scrooge in a dramatic Clock Tower finale. Use time pressure (4-hour countdown to midnight), Scrooge's radio taunts every 30 minutes, and workshop chaos to keep the pace snappy. Reward creativity with improvised weapons and environmental kills—this is Die Hard meets Home Alone in Santa's workshop!

### Key DMing Tips:
- **Time Pressure**: Remind players of the clock every 20-30 minutes of real time
- **Radio Taunts**: Use Scrooge's walkie-talkie for dramatic villain banter
- **Makeshift Gear**: Say "yes" to creative improvisation—rule of cool applies
- **Environmental Combat**: Push enemies into crushers, gears, and hazards
- **Moral Choice**: Scrooge can be redeemed (DC 18 Persuasion, harder but more satisfying)
- **No Long Rests**: Mrs. Claus's cookies provide short rest + spell slot recovery
- **Specialist Knowledge**: Grant advantage when players are in their character's area of expertise

## Opening Scene

**Location:** Various workshop locations converging to Service Corridor outside the Grand Hall  
**Time:** 8:00 PM (4 hours until midnight departure)

**Read Aloud - Setting the Scene:**

"It's 8:00 PM on Christmas Eve. The annual 'Eve of Departure' celebration is in full swing in the Grand Hall - laughter, music, the smell of cookies and cocoa. But not everyone could attend. Someone has to keep the workshop running."

### Introduce Each Character in Their Location:

**Northy,** you're in the Reindeer Stables adjacent to the Grand Hall, doing final pre-flight checks. Dasher's harness had a loose buckle earlier, and you're making sure it's secure. The reindeer seem nervous tonight - their ears keep swiveling toward the party sounds.

**Ginger,** you're completing your security patrol of the Loading Dock, checking the exterior doors one last time. Old habits die hard, even during celebrations. The night air is crisp, and fresh snow crunches under your gingerbread feet.

**Holly,** you're in the Sleigh Hangar three floors up, organizing the gift compartments by region. Prague absolutely cannot get Paris's presents. You're surrounded by wrapped packages and the massive sleigh gleaming with Christmas magic.

**Peppermint,** you're in the Enchantment Workshop on the second floor, recalibrating the magical arrays. The harmonic resonance has been off all day - someone tampered with them. You're trying to prevent a cascade failure when—

**Jolly,** you're high up in the Clock Tower, making final adjustments to the countdown mechanism. The gears must turn perfectly for the midnight launch. Through the tower window, you can see the party below, but the clock demands your attention.

**Cinnamon,** you're outside the main building, walking the perimeter and checking the magical wards that keep the workshop's eternal winter stable. They've been flickering strangely all evening, and you're investigating the disruption when—

### The Incident:

Suddenly, the festive music stops.

Shouting.

Glass breaking.

Then an eerie silence that feels wrong, unnatural.

An alarm begins to wail throughout the workshop - the emergency security system.

### The Convergence:

You all instinctively move toward the sound. Your different paths converge at the Service Corridor - a utilitarian hallway that runs behind the Grand Hall, used by staff for equipment access. It's the only route not sealed; the security lockdown has automatically locked down other passages.

The corridor is dimly lit by flickering enchanted bulbs. Steam hisses from overhead pipes carrying Christmas magic throughout the building. A maintenance locker stands slightly ajar near the wall - gremlins must have missed it in their hasty looting.

Through a small observation window in the wall, you see into the Grand Hall, and your hearts sink:

Masked figures hold candy cane crossbows on the partygoers. Everyone is frozen in fear. Santa Claus - her silver braid disheveled but standing tall and protective - positions herself in front of the other hostages, including her wife Mrs. Claus who looks defiant even in captivity.

And there, at the center of it all, draped in tattered Victorian coat and heavy spectral chains, stands an impossible figure from legend: **Ebenezer Scrooge.** His voice cuts through the silence like ice:

*"Nobody moves, nobody gets turned into a nutcracker. Christmas is nothing but HUMBUG - a foolish waste of joy and generosity. Tonight, I'm here for the List, the Vault, and to ensure Christmas is CANCELLED forever. Bah!"*

Behind him stand his twisted crew: corrupted snowmen with icicle claws, gingerbread enforcers gone stale and mean, rogue polar bears in dark armor, former elves who've turned to the Naughty side, and chittering gremlins causing chaos.

You look at each other - six workshop employees who happened to be elsewhere when catastrophe struck. None of you have your real equipment. It's all locked in the coat check room near the Grand Hall entrance... which is now surely guarded by Scrooge's forces.

But you DO have each other. And Christmas isn't going to save itself.

### Pause for Player Introductions:

Let each player briefly introduce their character - name, what they do at the workshop, and one personality trait or quirk.

### Then Continue:

The maintenance locker catches your eye. Inside you find:

- A tool belt with wrenches and screwdrivers (works as Thieves' Tools and Tinker's Tools)
- A gardener's pouch with dried mistletoe and holly (works as Druidic Focus)
- A foreman's badge, heavy iron gear symbol (works as Holy Symbol)
- A safety box cutter
- A fire extinguisher
- Some duct tape and wire

It's not much. But it's a start.

You have four hours until midnight - when the sleigh is supposed to launch and deliver presents to children around the world.

**What do you do?**

## Why Each Character Wasn't At The Party

- **Northy**: Doing pre-flight checks on reindeer (Dasher's harness, Vixen's antlers, settling the team)
- **Ginger**: Security patrol duty (someone needs to watch the perimeter during celebrations)
- **Holly**: Organizing sleigh gift compartments by region (logistics can't wait)
- **Peppermint**: Recalibrating magical arrays (detected tampering, trying to prevent failure)
- **Jolly**: Fixing countdown clock mechanism (must work perfectly for midnight launch)
- **Cinnamon**: Maintaining perimeter magical wards (they were flickering, investigating disruption)

All characters work at the workshop and know the layout well, with expertise in their respective areas.

## Workshop Knowledge by Character

- **Northy**: Stables, Hangar, Loading Dock, outdoor areas (expertise)
- **Ginger**: EVERYTHING - former Security Chief, knows all patrol routes, passages, security systems (best overall navigator)
- **Holly**: Loading Dock, Hangar, Gift Wrapping, delivery routes (logistics)
- **Peppermint**: Enchantment Workshop, Paint Workshop, magical areas (arcane knowledge)
- **Jolly**: Assembly Floor, Clock Tower, maintenance tunnels, mechanical rooms (technical access)
- **Cinnamon**: Enchantment areas, outdoor wards, natural spaces, magical infrastructure (nature/magic)

**DM Tip:** Grant advantage on Navigation, Investigation, or related checks when players are in their character's specialty area. Ginger can help with general navigation anywhere.

## About Equipment & The Coat Check

**Workshop Policy:** All weapons and heavy equipment must be checked at the main entrance before entering the building - even for employees just coming in for shifts. It's a safety regulation during the holiday season when the building is full of activity.

### What Players Currently Have:
- Armor they're wearing (armor is "protective gear" - allowed)
- Small personal items from their work areas
- Basic improvised tools from the maintenance locker

### What's Locked in Coat Check (guarded by Frostbite + gremlins):
- **Jolly**: Full tinker's tools kit, inventor's goggles, multi-tool wrench
- **Holly**: Thieves' tools, 50 ft rope, grappling hook, daggers
- **Ginger**: Longsword "Frostbrand", baking sheet shield, holy symbol (candy cane)
- **Northy**: Longbow, quiver with 20 arrows, shortsword
- **Peppermint**: Twisted peppermint staff (arcane focus), fancy spellbook, component pouch
- **Cinnamon**: Carved wooden staff, druidic focus pendant, herbalism kit

### OPTIONAL: The Coat Check Heist

**Important:** Don't let players recover this gear easily! The makeshift weapons are half the fun. However, if players are really determined and want to attempt a risky heist, you can allow it as a high-stakes side mission.

#### THE SETUP:
Coat Check is adjacent to Grand Hall (east entrance), currently guarded by:
- **Frostbite** (AC 14, HP 30) - Alert but focused on the hostages
- **2 Gremlins** (AC 12, HP 7 each) - Distracted, playing with confiscated items

#### THE HEIST (3-Round Stealth Puzzle):

**Round 1 - Approach (DC 15 Stealth):**
- Success: Reach coat check door undetected
- Failure: Frostbite's ears twitch, he's suspicious (+2 DC to next check)
- Critical Failure: Spotted immediately, combat begins

**Round 2 - Distraction (Group Check DC 13):**
Players must create a distraction to draw attention away. Options:
- Throw shiny ornament for gremlins (auto-success if they have one)
- Make noise elsewhere (Deception/Performance)
- Use magic creatively (DM discretion)

Success: Frostbite investigates, players have window
Failure: Frostbite stays put, must try different approach or risk combat

**Round 3 - The Grab (DC 14 Sleight of Hand or Stealth):**
- Success: Each player grabs ONE signature item (not full loadout!)
- Partial Success (10-13): Grab items but make noise, must flee immediately
- Failure: Frostbite roars and attacks, full combat

#### CONSEQUENCES:
- **Success**: Players each recover ONE signature item (weapon, focus, or tool - their choice)
- **Detected**: Frostbite + 2 gremlins pursue, raising alarm (attracts 1d4 more gingerbread guards in 2 rounds)
- **Combat**: If forced to fight Frostbite here, he can call for backup (hostages in danger!)

#### DM NOTES:
- Make this feel risky and tense, not easy
- Even on success, they get ONE item each, not everything
- The makeshift weapons should still be valuable and fun
- Consider this a "reward for boldness" rather than intended path
- If they trigger combat, hostages may be threatened as leverage
- Timing matters: attempting this late (after 10 PM) is easier as Frostbite is less focused

#### Example Signature Items Recovered:
- Ginger gets "Frostbrand" longsword back
- Holly gets her thieves' tools
- Peppermint gets peppermint staff (arcane focus)
- Jolly gets full tinker's tools kit
- Northy gets longbow + arrows
- Cinnamon gets druidic focus pendant

### Christmas Spirit Rule
The North Pole's magic is so potent that spellcasters can ignore material components without a gold cost. The very air hums with Christmas energy.

## The Naughty List Syndicate - Enemy Roster

### EBENEZER SCROOGE (Big Bad - The Spirit of Greed)

Gaunt man in tattered Victorian coat, heavy chains wrapped around him, clutching a gnarled money-counting staff. The Naughty & Nice List hangs from his belt. Eyes burning with bitter resentment. The one soul the Spirits couldn't fully redeem - he's relapsed into darkness.

**Why He's Evil:** After his redemption, Scrooge eventually grew bitter again watching the world's greed. He believes Christmas is a lie - temporary kindness that fades. He's come to "prove" Christmas doesn't matter by destroying it at its source.

### THE CORRUPTED CREW:

- **FROSTBITE** - Rogue Polar Bear Lieutenant (Massive polar bear in dark spiked armor, commands respect through fear, uses ice breath and claw attacks, Scrooge's enforcer and muscle)
- **GINGERSNAP** - Stale Gingerbread Enforcer (Hardened gingerbread man, cracked and mean, missing one gumdrop button eye patch, quick and ruthless)
- **SLUSH** - Melting Snowman Saboteur (Constantly dripping, corrupted by dark magic, coal heart turned black, leaves ice trail wherever he goes, giggles while sabotaging)
- **TINSEL** - Fallen Elf Thief (Former toy designer turned burglar, knows all workshop secrets, silver-tongued and cunning, wears dark green with tarnished bells)
- **COAL-HEART CHARLIE** - Gingerbread Demolitions Expert (Burnt gingerbread man obsessed with explosives, unstable and giggly, frosting scars across face)
- **THE FROST TWINS (Sleet & Hail)** - Corrupted Snowmen Guards (Identical snowmen, finish each other's sentences, work in perfect synchronization, one uses icicle weapons, other uses snowball artillery)
- **GRIZZLE** - Disgruntled Polar Bear Brute (Smaller but meaner than Frostbite, rejected from reindeer guard duty, holds serious grudges, wears torn security vest)
- **PEPPERMINT PATTY** - Twisted Candy Cane Crossbow Specialist (Former archer elf, red and white face paint war paint style, never misses or so she claims, cold precision)
- **THE GREMLIN SQUAD** - Chaos Causers (SPARK, WRENCH, GIZMO, BYTE and others - Small 2 ft tall, green, big ears, sharp teeth, obsessed with breaking things, work in packs, chittering constantly, steal shiny objects compulsively)

**Gremlin Stats:** AC 12, HP 7 each, flee at 3 HP or less  
**Attack:** Bite +4 (1d4+2 piercing)  
**Sabotage (Action):** Gremlin adjacent to a device, object, or mechanism forces DC 13 Dex save from anyone using it. On fail: device malfunctions (DM chooses effect - weapon jams, trap springs early, door locks, light goes out, etc.). Gremlins cackle with glee!  
**Swarm Tactics:** Advantage on attacks if 2+ gremlins near same target

## The Three Spirits - Ghostly Interventions

Throughout the workshop, the echoes of the Ghosts of Christmas Past, Present, and Future occasionally manifest as subtle hints and thematic whispers. They tried to redeem Scrooge once before - and they haven't given up on him yet. These are NOT full NPCs or combat encounters, just atmospheric moments that add resonance and guidance.

### GHOST OF CHRISTMAS PAST (Memories & Guidance)

**Manifestation:** Soft golden light, children's laughter echoing faintly, smell of old parchment and candlewax

**Where It Appears:**
- **Coal Processing Plant**: When players find Scrooge's letters and diary, a warm golden glow illuminates Tiny Tim's Christmas card. A child's voice whispers: "He was kind once... he can be again..."
- **Santa's Office**: A ghostly image flickers in the fireplace showing young Scrooge smiling at a Christmas party, before fading
- **When Players Struggle**: Faint voice: "Remember why you fight... for joy, for kindness, for each other..."

**Mechanical Benefit:** Once per adventure, when a player attempts to redeem or show mercy to an enemy, they can invoke the Ghost of Christmas Past for advantage on the Persuasion check. The ghost whispers encouragement: "Redemption is always possible..."

### GHOST OF CHRISTMAS PRESENT (Aid & Abundance)

**Manifestation:** Evergreen scent, sound of sleigh bells, warm firelight glow, cornucopia of festive abundance

**Where It Appears:**
- **Mrs. Claus's Kitchen**: When players enter, the oven fire burns extra bright and Mrs. Claus mysteriously has MORE cookies than she thought: "How strange... it's as if someone blessed my baking..."
- **Gift Wrapping Station**: A wrapped present appears that wasn't there before - contains useful improvised equipment (DM's choice)
- **During Combat**: Faint sleigh bells jingle, granting one ally +1d4 to their next attack roll (once per combat encounter)

**Mechanical Benefit:** Once per adventure, a player can call upon the Ghost of Christmas Present. Roll 1d6:
1. Heal 2d8 HP
2. Gain temp HP equal to level × 3
3. Next ally's attack has advantage
4. Find a useful item nearby
5. Enemy's next attack has disadvantage
6. Reroll any failed save

A jolly laugh echoes through the workshop and abundance appears where there was scarcity.

### GHOST OF CHRISTMAS YET TO COME (Warnings & Omens)

**Manifestation:** Cold wind, distant clock chimes, shadows lengthening, sense of urgency and foreboding

**Where It Appears:**
- **Clock Tower**: A cloaked shadow appears briefly on the upper platform, pointing at the gears - warning of the danger
- **Sleigh Hangar**: When approaching the bomb, icy wind blows and players glimpse a vision of the sleigh exploding in flames (warning)
- **Before Scrooge Fight**: Shadow figure gestures toward Scrooge, then touches its own chest where a heart would be - "He can still be saved..."
- **When Time is Running Out**: Clock chimes echo louder, wind picks up: "Hurry... the future is not yet written..."

**Mechanical Benefit:** Once per adventure, when disaster is about to strike (bomb about to explode, ally about to die, crucial failure), the Ghost warns them:
- A player gets a vision of the terrible outcome 6 seconds before it happens
- They can change one action or warn allies
- Effectively a "do-over" of one round of actions
- The shadow points urgently - you see what WILL happen... unless you act NOW!

### USING THE SPIRITS EFFECTIVELY

**Subtlety is Key:** These should feel like atmospheric blessings, not direct intervention. The spirits are bound by cosmic rules - they can hint and guide but not act directly.

**Thematic Timing:**
- Past appears when redemption or mercy is possible
- Present appears during moments of fellowship, sharing, or celebration
- Future appears as warnings during danger or when time pressure mounts

**At the Final Confrontation:** If players use the Spirit of Christmas Past's Mirror (from Coal Processing) on Scrooge, all three spirits briefly appear:
- **Past**: Shows young Scrooge's happiest Christmas
- **Present**: Shows the joy Scrooge is trying to destroy
- **Future**: Shows two paths - one where he dies bitter and alone, another where he's redeemed and welcomed

This triple vision grants advantage on Persuasion to redeem Scrooge and reduces DC from 18 to 15.

**Scrooge's Reaction to Spirit Manifestations:** If he senses them: *"YOU! You haunted me before! I won't listen again! Your visions were LIES! People don't change! Nothing LASTS!"* (He's deeply afraid of them - they represent his greatest failure to stay redeemed)

**DM Note:** Use these sparingly - 2-3 times total across the adventure. They should feel like magical Christmas moments, not constant deus ex machina.

## Key Villain Encounters

### SCROOGE'S PLAN & MOVEMENT

**Scrooge's Three-Pronged Plan to Cancel Christmas:**
1. ✅ **Steal The Naughty & Nice List** (done at 8:00 PM from the Grand Hall party) - Without it, wrong gifts go to wrong children, chaos ensues
2. ⚠️ **Rob the Legendary Toy Vault** (his crew working on it) - Steal powerful magical items
3. ⚠️ **Sabotage the Midnight Launch** (his personal priority) - Destroy the Clock Tower mechanism

**Why the Clock Tower?**
- It's the HEART of Christmas operations - without the countdown, there's no synchronized midnight launch
- Even if vault and sleigh are secured, stopping the clock prevents Christmas delivery
- Thematic: Scrooge is obsessed with time and money - stopping time itself is his ultimate revenge
- Symbolic: He's trying to freeze Christmas in failure forever

### Scrooge's Location Timeline:

**8:00-9:00 PM: Grand Hall**
- Takes List immediately (it was at the party)
- Holds Santa and hostages
- Directs his crew via walkie-talkie

**9:00 PM: Leaves Grand Hall**
- Leaves Frostbite (polar bear lieutenant) + guards to watch hostages
- Takes The List with him (hangs from belt)
- Radios: *"I have what I came for. The List is MINE!"*

**9:00-10:00 PM: Moving Through Workshop**
- Checking on vault operation
- Heading toward Clock Tower (his final objective)

**10:00 PM-Midnight: Clock Tower (Final Confrontation)**
- Personally sabotaging the countdown mechanism
- This is his insurance - even if everything else fails, no clock = no Christmas
- Players find him here for climactic battle

### Scrooge's Radio Taunts (Use these to telegraph his movement):

**9:00 PM (After players complete first objective):** *"My my, you've been busy. But you're too late. I already have The List. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have a clock to attend to... Tick tock, heroes. Tick tock."*

**10:00 PM (When players complete second objective):** *"Still playing hero? I'm at the heart of it all now - the Clock Tower. Without this mechanism working, there IS no midnight launch. Come stop me... if you can. Bah! Humbug!"*

**10:30 PM (If players are slow):** *"The gears are so delicate... one wrong adjustment and they'll never turn again. Time's running out - quite literally! Hurry, hurry!"*

### REACTIVE TAUNTS (Use after specific player successes):

**After Vault Secured:** *"Petty thieves! You think stopping ONE plan matters? The vault was a DISTRACTION, you fools! While you played with toys, I've been dismantling Christmas itself!"*

**After Sleigh Bomb Disarmed:** *"IMPOSSIBLE! Charlie, you incompetent CRUMB! I should have known better than to trust a burnt gingerbread man with explosives! No matter... the clock still ticks..."*

**After Reindeer Recruited:** *"No... not the ungulates! You've turned my own flying draft animals against me?! BAH! Animals are more loyal than people - that's the only lesson here!"*

**After Defeating a Lieutenant (Frostbite, Gingersnap, Slush):** *"So you've bested [villain name]. Congratulations. You've proven you can beat ONE broken soul. But can you stop ALL of us? Can you stop ME?"*

**After Finding Coal Processing/Backstory:** *[Long pause, then quietly, bitterly] "...So you found my failure. My shame. Yes, I TRIED! And the world crushed me for it! Don't you DARE judge me!"*

**After Freeing Hostages Early:** *"The hostages? You think I NEED hostages? They were just... insurance. The clock is all that matters now. THAT is where Christmas dies!"*

**If Players Are Doing Too Well:** *"You think you're WINNING?! Every second you waste congratulating yourselves is another second closer to MIDNIGHT! Tick... tock... TICK... TOCK!"*

### EBENEZER SCROOGE (Big Bad - The Spirit of Greed)

**Location:** Grand Hall with hostages (8:00-9:00 PM) OR moves to Clock Tower at 10:00 PM for final stand

**Appearance:** Gaunt man in tattered Victorian coat, heavy spectral chains wrapped around torso, clutches gnarled money-counting staff. The Naughty & Nice List hangs from his belt. Eyes burning with bitter resentment.

#### STATS:
- **AC** 16 (spectral chains act as armor)
- **HP** 75
- **Speed:** 30 ft, can teleport 30 ft in coal dust cloud (bonus action, recharge 5-6)
- **Multiattack:** 2 attacks with staff
- **Money-Counting Staff:** +6 to hit, 2d6+4 bludgeoning + 1d6 cold (greed chills the heart)
- **Damage Dampening Chains (Reaction, 2/round):** When hit by an attack, ghostly chains wrap around Scrooge and reduce damage by 10. *"My chains protect me from your futile efforts!"*

#### SPELLCASTING (uses greed/cold magic):
- **Command** (at will): "KNEEL!" "FREEZE!" "FLEE!"
- **Hold Person** (3/day): Chains of spectral gold bind target
- **Darkness** (2/day): Snuffs out hope and light
- **Shatter** (2/day): Shatters joy and objects alike
- **Counterspell** (1/day): "Bah! Humbug to your magic!"

#### LEGENDARY ACTIONS (2 points per round, used after other creatures' turns):
- **Move (1 point):** Teleports 30 ft in coal dust cloud (can't be opportunity attacked)
- **Bitter Monologue (1 point):** One creature within 30 ft must make DC 15 Wis save or be frightened until end of their next turn
- **Cast Spell (2 points):** Casts Command or throws a coal bomb (3d6 fire, 10 ft radius, DC 14 Dex save)

**Legendary Resistance (1/day):** Can choose to succeed on a failed save. *"I didn't survive poverty and ghosts to fall to YOUR tricks!"*

#### ENVIRONMENTAL ACTIONS (Clock Tower Only):
- **Ring the Bell (Recharge 4-6):** Action. Deafens everyone except Scrooge in the tower for 1 round (DC 13 Con save negates). Creates dramatic reverberating chaos.
- **Shove Into Gears:** +6 Athletics contested check vs target within 5 ft. On success: target takes 2d6 bludgeoning and is restrained between gears (DC 15 Str to escape).

#### QUICK TACTICS:
- Opens with Hold Person on the "kindest" or most "hopeful" PC
- Teleports every round to avoid melee (coal dust clouds appear dramatically)
- Focuses on hope-driven characters to prove "generosity is weakness"
- Retreats at 25 HP to Clock Tower for final stand
- Uses Bitter Monologue to disrupt morale and make players doubt themselves
- In Clock Tower: Uses environmental hazards (gears, pendulum, bells) aggressively

#### PERSONALITY:
Bitter, dramatic, genuinely believes Christmas is a temporary lie that people use to feel good before returning to selfishness

**Quotes:**
- *"Bah! HUMBUG! You think your heroics matter? Christmas changes nothing!"*
- *"I WAS redeemed once. It didn't last. Nothing does!"*
- *"Every spirit, every ghost, every kindness... MEANINGLESS!"*
- *"The List? Oh, I'll use it. I'll show them ALL the futility of their hope!"*

#### SPECIAL MECHANIC - THE LIST:
- Scrooge wears The Naughty & Nice List on his belt
- A player can attempt to steal it (DC 16 Sleight of Hand or grapple + DC 15 Athletics to pull it free)
- If a player uses the Spirit of Christmas Past's Mirror (from Coal Processing Easter Egg), Scrooge must make DC 16 Wis save or be stunned for 1 round as he sees his happiest Christmas memory

#### DEFEAT OPTIONS:
- **Combat (standard)** - Reduce to 0 HP
- **Redemption (hard)** - DC 18 Persuasion check, advantage if:
  - Players found his letters in Coal Processing
  - Players show him Tiny Tim's card
  - Players use the Spirit's Mirror
  - Players invoke the memory of the Ghosts of Christmas
- **Trick** - Lure him into environmental trap (crusher, clock gears, etc.)
- **Reindeer Tackle** - If players recruited reindeer, they can charge him (opposed Athletics, reindeer have +8)
- **Steal The List and Escape** - If players just want to save Christmas without fighting

#### UPON DEFEAT (Combat):
Scrooge collapses, chains clinking. *"I... I tried to be better once. Why wasn't it enough? Why does the world stay cruel?"* He fades, leaving only The List and his staff.

#### UPON REDEMPTION:
Scrooge falls to his knees, tears freezing on his cheeks. *"I... I forgot. It's not about changing THEM. It's about staying changed YOURSELF. The Spirits... Tiny Tim... they tried to teach me. Thank you for... reminding me."* The chains dissolve. He helps free the hostages. *"God bless us... every one."*

## Timeline & Tension

- **8:00 PM** - Heist begins (START)
- **9:00 PM** - Scrooge takes List, leaves Grand Hall, vault is 50% open
- **10:00 PM** - Vault fully breached (if players don't stop it), Scrooge arrives at Clock Tower
- **11:00 PM** - Scrooge sabotaging clock mechanism
- **11:30 PM** - Bomb arms on sleigh (if not disarmed)
- **11:45 PM** - Point of no return
- **MIDNIGHT** - Launch time / Bomb detonates / Christmas RUINED

Every 30 minutes of game time, remind players of the clock. Play up the urgency!

## Random Encounter Table (Roll d6 if players are loud/slow)

1. **Gremlin Patrol** - SNICKERDOODLE (gingerbread thug, AC 12, HP 12) + 2 gremlins (FIDGET & WRANGLE) patrolling, muttering about shifts
2. **False Alarm** - Toy activates, makes noise, draws CINNAMON (gingerbread guard, AC 12, HP 12) + 1 gremlin to investigate
3. **Mrs. Claus's Sabotage** - She releases toy soldiers elsewhere, creating distraction. Players gain advantage on Stealth for 10 minutes
4. **Reindeer Escape** - Reindeer break out of stables, cause chaos, trampling 1d4 gremlins. Advantage for next 10 minutes
5. **Villain Radio Chatter** - Overhear Scrooge berating Tinsel and Slush: *"You incompetent fools! Must I do EVERYTHING myself? Positions, NOW!"*
6. **Lucky Find** - Discover extra makeshift equipment or hidden passage (and avoid SPRINKLES the sleepy gingerbread guard + dozing gremlin)

**Note:** Gremlins flee at 3 HP or less. They're cowards but dangerous in packs!

## Victory Conditions

### FULL SUCCESS:
- Hostages freed
- Sleigh saved
- Vault secured
- Scrooge defeated/redeemed
- Launch at midnight happens
- *"Christmas is saved! You're on the Nice List forever!"*

### PARTIAL SUCCESS:
- Some objectives met, but complications (delayed launch, some vault items stolen, etc.)
- *"Christmas is saved, but barely. Thank you!"*

### FAILURE:
- Bomb detonates, Christmas cancelled
- Villains escape with List/Vault items
- *"There's always next year... if we can rebuild."*

## DM Tips

✅ **Reward Creativity:** Players will come up with wild ideas with makeshift items. Say "yes" when possible! Rule of cool applies.

✅ **Play Up the Clock:** Every 20-30 minutes of real time, mention in-game time and Scrooge's radio taunts.

✅ **Environmental Combat:** The workshop is FULL of interactive elements. Let players use conveyor belts, gears, catapults creatively!

✅ **Die Hard Vibes:** Play Christmas music in background. Have villains quote Scrooge or Dickens. Make it cinematic with dramatic one-liners!

✅ **Moral Complexity:** Scrooge isn't pure evil - he's broken and bitter. Redemption is possible and more satisfying than just killing him.

✅ **Adjust Difficulty:**
- Too hard? Have Mrs. Claus or reindeer help more
- Too easy? Add more gremlins or boost villain HP
- Keep fights 3-4 rounds max for pacing

✅ **Makeshift Equipment:** Players should feel CLEVER for improvising, not punished for lacking real gear.

✅ **Epic Moments:** When players do something awesome (ride reindeer, swing from tinsel, surf conveyor belt), describe it like an action movie!

✅ **Scrooge's Radio:** Use it every 30 minutes of game time for taunts, threats, and building tension

✅ **The List MacGuffin:** Remember it's on Scrooge's belt! Let the Rogue steal it during combat for a big heroic moment.

✅ **Short Rest Adventure:** This is meant to be run without Long Rests. Mrs. Claus's enhanced cookies function as Short Rest + spell slot recovery.

✅ **Gremlin Behavior:**
- Flee at 3 HP or below
- Distracted by shiny objects
- Work better in packs (swarm tactics)
- Cause chaos and sabotage equipment
- Comic relief but still dangerous

✅ **Combat Speed:**
- Use average damage for monsters
- Group initiative for minions (all gremlins go together)
- Enemies flee or surrender at low HP (morale checks)

✅ **The Coat Check:** Don't let players get their real gear back early! It's either:
- Looted by gremlins (gone)
- Locked behind Frostbite (too dangerous early)
- They can recover it AFTER defeating Scrooge as reward

## Closing Scene (If Successful)

The clock strikes midnight. Bells ring throughout the workshop. Hostages are freed and cheer. Santa Claus - her silver braid disheveled but her eyes bright with pride - shakes each player's hand firmly. Mrs. Claus embraces them warmly. The List is safely returned.

### If Scrooge was defeated in combat:
Santa looks sadly at Scrooge's empty chains. *"Even the hardest heart deserves a chance at redemption. We'll try again next year. He'll be back on the Nice List... eventually."* Mrs. Claus adds softly, *"We never give up on anyone."*

### If Scrooge was redeemed:
Scrooge stands beside both Santa and Mrs. Claus, chains gone, tears in his eyes. *"I forgot what the Spirits taught me - Christmas isn't about changing others. It's about staying changed yourself. Thank you for reminding me."* He helps repair the workshop damage. *"Perhaps... perhaps I can work here. Help others remember, as you helped me."*

### Santa's Speech:
*"You've shown the true spirit of Christmas tonight - courage, creativity, and caring for others. Not just in fighting, but in choosing to see the good even in those who've lost their way. You are heroes of the North Pole!"* Mrs. Claus nods: *"We couldn't have asked for braver defenders."*

The sleigh launches into the starry night. Reindeer pull it across the moon, Santa at the reins with Mrs. Claus beside her. Players watch from the Clock Tower as Christmas is saved. Mrs. Claus brings hot cocoa for everyone.

### REWARDS:
- Permanent place of honor in workshop
- One magical toy of choice from vault (keep permanently)
- Santa and Mrs. Claus's personal thanks and blessing
- +1 Candy Cane weapons that actually work (1d6+1, light, can be used as rations once)
- Title: "Defenders of Christmas"
- Special: Each player's name added to the Nice List in golden ink
- XP: Full level 5 milestone (ready to advance to 6)

### Scrooge's Fate (if redeemed):
Becomes the new "Second Chance Coordinator" at the North Pole, helping others who've lost their way find Christmas spirit again.

### Post-Credits Scene (optional):
As players leave, a single gremlin (SPARK) approaches sheepishly, returning their stolen items from the coat check. *"Sorry... we just like shiny things. You're... you're nice. Can we be on Nice List too?"* Santa chuckles warmly: *"Everyone gets a chance, little one. Everyone."*
