Six workshop employees who weren't at the celebration must use makeshift weapons, creative tactics, and environmental combat to stop Scrooge's multi-pronged plan:
1. ✅ Steal The Naughty & Nice List (already done!)
2. ⚠️ Rob the Legendary Toy Vault
3. ⚠️ Plant a bomb in the Sleigh Hangar

## A Note for DMs

<details>
<summary><strong>💡 DM Philosophy & Playtest Tips (DM/Spoilers - Click to Expand)</strong></summary>

**Your players will do unexpected things. That's not a failure of prep — it's the point.**

This adventure is designed as a **toolkit, not a script**. Rooms, encounters, and paths are intentionally loose so you can adapt on the fly. Players from playtests have:
- Stormed the Grand Hall immediately, or went outside which I hadn't planned for initially
- Crawled through pipes that were barely sketched out
- Optimized routes like a speedrun OR meandered for character moments

**All valid. All fun.**

The map connections are suggestions. Time pressure is your balancing tool. If a player choice is clever, cinematic, or fun — **make it work**. Collapse or expand paths based on pacing. The ambiguity is intentional, giving you freedom to shape the session to your table.

## Quick Start Guide

### For DMs (First Time Running)

1. **Review the [DM Guide](dm-materials/dm-guide.md)** Focus on opening scene, key villain encounters, and 3-hour session path
2. **Skim [Enemy Reference](dm-materials/enemies.md)** Familiarize yourself with Scrooge and key lieutenants
3. **Review [Combat Maps](dm-materials/combat-maps.md)** At minimum: Loading Dock, and Clock Tower. If there is time then go to Vault OR Sleigh Hangar. I had one game where they ended up in the Grand Hall and I collaposed the Clock Tower scene there.
4. **Send [Character Sheets](characters/characters.md) to Players** - Let them pick a pre-gen, modify one to their liking, or create their own level 5 character
5. **Print/Prep Materials** - Character sheets, workshop map, reference sheets
6. **Prepare Atmosphere** - Christmas music playlist, timer visible to players

### For Players

1. **Choose a [Pre-generated Character](characters/characters.md)**, modify one to fit your playstyle, or create your own level 5 character from scratch
3. **Read your character's personality and "Why Not At Party"** section
4. **Understand your role** - Tank, damage, support, skills
5. **Be ready to improvise!** - Things are not always as they seem at the start
