### Synopsis

It's Christmas Eve, 8:00 PM. The annual celebration is in full swing at Santa's Workshop when the impossible happens: **Ebenezer Scrooge** and his Naughty List Syndicate crash the party and take everyone hostage!

Six workshop employees who weren't at the celebration must use makeshift weapons, creative tactics, and environmental combat to stop Scrooge's multi-pronged plan:
1. ✅ Steal The Naughty & Nice List (already done!)
2. ⚠️ Rob the Legendary Toy Vault
3. ⚠️ Plant a bomb in the Sleigh Hangar
4. ⚠️ Sabotage the Clock Tower to prevent midnight launch

You have **4 hours until midnight**. The clock is ticking. Christmas is counting on you.

## A Note for DMs

**Your players will do unexpected things. That's not a failure of prep — it's the point.**

This adventure is designed as a **toolkit, not a script**. Rooms, encounters, and paths are intentionally loose so you can adapt on the fly. Players from playtests have:
- Stormed the Grand Hall immediately, or went outside which I hadn't planned for initially
- Crawled through pipes that were barely sketched out
- Optimized routes like a speedrun OR meandered for character moments

**All valid. All fun.**

The map connections are suggestions. Time pressure is your balancing tool. If a player choice is clever, cinematic, or fun — **make it work**. Collapse or expand paths based on pacing. The ambiguity is intentional, giving you freedom to shape the session to your table.

## Quick Start Guide

### For DMs (First Time Running)

1. **Review the [DM Guide](dm-materials/dm-guide.md)** Focus on opening scene, key villain encounters, and 3-hour session path
2. **Skim [Enemy Reference](dm-materials/enemies.md)** Familiarize yourself with Scrooge and key lieutenants
3. **Review [Combat Maps](dm-materials/combat-maps.md)** At minimum: Loading Dock, and Clock Tower. If there is time then go to Vault OR Sleigh Hangar. I had one game where they ended up in the Grand Hall and I collaposed the Clock Tower scene there.
4. **Send [Character Sheets](characters/characters.md) to Players** - Let them pick a pre-gen, modify one to their liking, or create their own level 5 character
5. **Print/Prep Materials** - Character sheets, workshop map, reference sheets
6. **Prepare Atmosphere** - Christmas music playlist, timer visible to players

### For Players

1. **Choose a [Pre-generated Character](characters/characters.md)**, modify one to fit your playstyle, or create your own level 5 character from scratch
3. **Read your character's personality and "Why Not At Party"** section
4. **Understand your role** - Tank, damage, support, skills
5. **Be ready to improvise!** - Things are not always as they seem at the start

## Play Testing Notes

This campaign has been run successfully and here's what we learned:

### What Worked Great
- ✅ Makeshift weapons were hilarious and creative
- ✅ Time pressure kept energy high
- ✅ Environmental kills were player favorites (crusher, gears, catapults)

### DM Tips from Actual Play
- Keep fights to 3-4 rounds max
- Use Scrooge's radio taunts religiously - they're great for pacing
- Let players steal from Gift Wrapping and Paint Workshop early
- The bomb puzzle is tense - give them the clue if they're stuck
- Gremlins fleeing at 3 HP creates great comedy
- Final fight in Clock Tower with rotating gears is epic

### Common Player Paths
- **Path A:** Loading Dock → Kitchen → Sleigh → Vault → Clock Tower
- **Path B:** Loading Dock → Kitchen → Vault → Reindeer → Grand Hall Assault → Clock Tower
- **Path C:** Loading Dock → Gift Wrap → Paint Shop → Sleigh → Clock Tower (speedrun)
